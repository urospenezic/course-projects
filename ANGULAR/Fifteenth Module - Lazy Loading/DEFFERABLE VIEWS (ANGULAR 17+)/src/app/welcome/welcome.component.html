    <h2>Build Web Apps With Angular!</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Angular is one of the most popular modern web development frameworks out
    there!
  </p>
  <p>
    It's getting used by thousands of developers and companies since it allows
    developers to build powerful, highly interactive web applications with ease!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst you could use "just JavaScript" to build such applications, Angular
    vastly simplifies the process and allows you to build applications with a
    clear, modular structure - a feature that's especially important as
    applications become more complex.

    <h2>What Does This Course Offer?</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    This course will teach you all the fundamentals about components, templates,
    directives, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a
    lot of deep dives and build multiple demo projects along the way. All
    examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them
    correctly.
  </p>

  <p>Best of all? This course doesn't stop at the basics!</p>

  <p>
    We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into Angular as well as
    TypeScript concepts which are especially important for Angular developers!

<!-- prefetch on hover means: "when the user hovers over this element, prefetch the component"-->
@defer(on interaction; prefetch on hover) {<!--without any configuration, this will be deffered until the browser is idle (on + something in parethesis is the configuration, (on idle, viewport, interaction, hover, immediate, timer..))-->
<!-- WE CAN ALSO USE on interaction(some template variable) to trigger the loading of the component based on other elements on the page (like if we had a <button #myButton> we can use on interaction(myButton))-->
<!--on viewport says: "when the user can see it"-->
<app-offer-preview />
}@placeholder {<!-- placeholder for whilst its off the viewport
  IF WE HAD ON INTERACTION, ANGULAR WOULD WAIT UNTIL WE CLICK ON THIS ELEEMENT TO LOAD UP THE <APP-OFFER-PREVIEW>
